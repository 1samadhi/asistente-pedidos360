## 4.1. Registered Claim Names

The following Claim Names are registered in the IANA "JSON Web Token
   Claims" registry established by Section 10.1.  None of the claims
   defined below are intended to be mandatory to use or implement in all
   cases, but rather they provide a starting point for a set of useful,
   interoperable claims.  Applications using JWTs should define which
   specific claims they use and when they are required or optional.  All
   the names are short because a core goal of JWTs is for the
   representation to be compact.

## 4.1.1. "iss" (Issuer) Claim

The "iss" (issuer) claim identifies the principal that issued the
   JWT.  The processing of this claim is generally application specific.
   The "iss" value is a case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI
   value.  Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.

## 4.1.2. "sub" (Subject) Claim

The "sub" (subject) claim identifies the principal that is the
   subject of the JWT.  The claims in a JWT are normally statements
   about the subject.  The subject value MUST either be scoped to be
   locally unique in the context of the issuer or be globally unique.
   The processing of this claim is generally application specific.  The
   "sub" value is a case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI
   value.  Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.

## 4.1.3. "aud" (Audience) Claim

The "aud" (audience) claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is
   intended for.  Each principal intended to process the JWT MUST
   identify itself with a value in the audience claim.  If the principal
   processing the claim does not identify itself with a value in the
   "aud" claim when this claim is present, then the JWT MUST be
   rejected.  In the general case, the "aud" value is an array of case-
   sensitive strings, each containing a StringOrURI value.  In the
   special case when the JWT has one audience, the "aud" value MAY be a
   single case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI value.  The
   interpretation of audience values is generally application specific.
   Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.

## 4.1.4. "exp" (Expiration Time) Claim

The "exp" (expiration time) claim identifies the expiration time on
   or after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing.  The
   processing of the "exp" claim requires that the current date/time
   MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the "exp" claim.







   Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more than
   a few minutes, to account for clock skew.  Its value MUST be a number
   containing a NumericDate value.  Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.

## 4.1.6. "iat" (Issued At) Claim

The "iat" (issued at) claim identifies the time at which the JWT was
   issued.  This claim can be used to determine the age of the JWT.  Its
   value MUST be a number containing a NumericDate value.  Use of this
   claim is OPTIONAL.

## 4.1.7. "jti" (JWT ID) Claim

The "jti" (JWT ID) claim provides a unique identifier for the JWT.
   The identifier value MUST be assigned in a manner that ensures that
   there is a negligible probability that the same value will be
   accidentally assigned to a different data object; if the application
   uses multiple issuers, collisions MUST be prevented among values
   produced by different issuers as well.  The "jti" claim can be used
   to prevent the JWT from being replayed.  The "jti" value is a case-
   sensitive string.  Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.

## 7.2. Validating a JWT

When validating a JWT, the following steps are performed.  The order
   of the steps is not significant in cases where there are no
   dependencies between the inputs and outputs of the steps.  If any of
   the listed steps fail, then the JWT MUST be rejected -- that is,
   treated by the application as an invalid input.

   1.   Verify that the JWT contains at least one period ('.')
        character.

   2.   Let the Encoded JOSE Header be the portion of the JWT before the
        first period ('.') character.

   3.   Base64url decode the Encoded JOSE Header following the
        restriction that no line breaks, whitespace, or other additional
        characters have been used.

   4.   Verify that the resulting octet sequence is a UTF-8-encoded
        representation of a completely valid JSON object conforming to
        RFC 7159 [RFC7159]; let the JOSE Header be this JSON object.

   5.   Verify that the resulting JOSE Header includes only parameters
        and values whose syntax and semantics are both understood and
        supported or that are specified as being ignored when not
        understood.

   6.   Determine whether the JWT is a JWS or a JWE using any of the
        methods described in Section 9 of [JWE].








   7.   Depending upon whether the JWT is a JWS or JWE, there are two
        cases:

        *  If the JWT is a JWS, follow the steps specified in [JWS] for
           validating a JWS.  Let the Message be the result of base64url
           decoding the JWS Payload.

        *  Else, if the JWT is a JWE, follow the steps specified in
           [JWE] for validating a JWE.  Let the Message be the resulting
           plaintext.

   8.   If the JOSE Header contains a "cty" (content type) value of
        "JWT", then the Message is a JWT that was the subject of nested
        signing or encryption operations.  In this case, return to Step
        1, using the Message as the JWT.

   9.   Otherwise, base64url decode the Message following the
        restriction that no line breaks, whitespace, or other additional
        characters have been used.

   10.  Verify that the resulting octet sequence is a UTF-8-encoded
        representation of a completely valid JSON object conforming to
        RFC 7159 [RFC7159]; let the JWT Claims Set be this JSON object.

   Finally, note that it is an application decision which algorithms may
   be used in a given context.  Even if a JWT can be successfully
   validated, unless the algorithms used in the JWT are acceptable to
   the application, it SHOULD reject the JWT.

## 11. Security Considerations

All of the security issues that are pertinent to any cryptographic
   application must be addressed by JWT/JWS/JWE/JWK agents.  Among these
   issues are protecting the user's asymmetric private and symmetric
   secret keys and employing countermeasures to various attacks.

   All the security considerations in the JWS specification also apply
   to JWT, as do the JWE security considerations when encryption is
   employed.  In particular, Sections 10.12 ("JSON Security
   Considerations") and 10.13 ("Unicode Comparison Security
   Considerations") of [JWS] apply equally to the JWT Claims Set in the
   same manner that they do to the JOSE Header.
